# Vehicles Streamlit Analysis

### Project Description
Using a dataframe of cars for sale, the notebook does an EDA in a car prices dataset, so we can create a  web App with streamlit and plot graphs using plotly.

This project consists of a Web App with the aim of analyzing data from the car sales dataframe, using interactive graphs and a sidebar with a checkbox to generate histograms, we can analyze cars by price, model year, model, condition, cylinders, odometer and type.

### Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis.
- Use plotly to generate interactive graphs.
- Use streamlit to create the web app.

### Tools and Libs used
- Python: Main language used for analysis.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Plotly: Pandas: Library to generate interactive graphics.
- Streamlit: Library to create the web app.
- Render: Platform to deploy the web app.

### Learnings
This project allowed me to develop the following skills:

- Data analysis: interpreting and extracting valuable insights from large volumes of data.
- Data cleaning: identifying and correcting missing, duplicate, and anomalous values.
- Creating interactive graphics: using Plotly to visualize data in an intuitive and informative way.
- Use of libraries and tools: practical application of various libraries and tools from the Python ecosystem, such as Pandas and Plotly.
